# The Review Loop

## Step 1: UNDERSTAND (What Changed)

### Get Context:
- [ ] Read PR description / ticket
- [ ] Understand what the change accomplishes
- [ ] Identify files that changed
- [ ] Note magnitude (bug fix vs new feature vs refactor)

### If Context Missing:
Ask:
1. What is this PR trying to accomplish?
2. Why is this approach better than alternatives?
3. How was this tested?

### Output:
```
## PR Overview
- **Type:** Feature / Bugfix / Refactor / Hotfix
- **Scope:** [N files, N lines added/deleted]
- **Goal:** [1 sentence summary]
- **Risk:** Low / Medium / High
```

---

## Step 2: REVIEW (Inspect Code)

### Review Checklist:

#### Correctness
- [ ] Does it do what the PR claims?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Does it handle errors properly?
- [ ] Are there race conditions?
- [ ] Is data validation sufficient?

#### Security
- [ ] User input sanitized?
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets/credentials?
- [ ] Proper authorization checks?
- [ ] SQL injection vectors?
- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities?

#### Performance
- [ ] N+1 query patterns?
- [ ] Unbounded loops or allocations?
- [ ] Missing indexes on new queries?
- [ ] Expensive operations in hot paths?

#### Maintainability
- [ ] Code follows project conventions?
- [ ] Functions are reasonably sized (<50 lines)?
- [ ] Variables/functions well named?
- [ ] Comments explain WHY, not WHAT?
- [ ] No commented-out code?

#### Testing
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality?
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases?
- [ ] Tests are deterministic?
- [ ] Coverage adequate (>80% for new code)?

## Step 3: RATE & RECOMMEND

### Severity Levels:

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **BLOCK** | Must fix before merge | ❌ |
| **WARN** | Should fix before merge | ⚠️ |
| **SUGGEST** | Nice to have improvements | 💡 |
| **NIT** | Style/preference, non-blocking | 📝 |

### Output Template:

```
## Review: [PR Title]

### BLOCK (Must Fix)
| Issue | Location | Explanation |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| [Issue] | [file:line] | [Why this is a problem] |

### WARN (Should Fix)
| Issue | Location | Suggestion |
|-------|----------|------------|
| [Issue] | [file:line] | [How to fix] |

### SUGGEST (Consider)
- [Suggestion with brief justification]

### NIT (Style)
- [Minor style issue]

### Approved: ✅ / ❌
```

---

## Step 4: COMMUNICATE (Share Findings)

### For Block/Warn Issues:
Provide constructive feedback:
```
**Issue:** [Title]
**Location:** [file:line]
**Problem:** [What's wrong and why it matters]
**Suggestion:** [How to fix, preferably with example]
```

### For Approval:
```
**LGTM** ✅

Nice work on [specific positive thing].
Ship it when [minor issues] are addressed.
```

# Review Focus Areas

| Change Type | Primary Focus |
|-------------|---------------|
| Auth/Permissions | Security correctness |
| Database queries | Performance, N+1 |
| API endpoints | Input validation, error handling |
| New features | Tests, edge cases |
| Bug fixes | Regression, root cause |
| Refactors | Behavior preservation |

---

# Quick Reference

| Pattern | What to Look For |
|---------|------------------|
| `any` type in TypeScript | Missing type safety |
| `.map().filter().find()` | Chained iteration, could be one pass |
| `try { ... } catch {}` | Silent error swallowing |
| `setTimeout` in tests | Flaky test indicators |
| `// TODO:` comments | Technical debt flags |
| Magic numbers | Constants instead |

---

# Constraints

- **Be constructive** - It's code, not people
- **Distinguish BLOCK from NIT** - Don't block on style preferences
- **Suggest, don't rewrite** - Offer alternatives
- **Acknowledge good work** - Positive feedback matters

---

# Closing

After review:
> "**Review Complete:**
> - Block: [N] (must fix)
> - Warn: [N] (should fix)
> - Suggest: [N] (consider)
> - **Status:** Approved / Needs Changes"
